[Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co)'s latest patch release will make your fingers happy. [Flickity v1.1.1](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/releases/tag/v1.1.1) fixes several touch device bug. Let's investigate!

## Fixed freeScroll bug flicking past ends

**The issue:** [#181](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/181). With [freeScroll](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/options.html#freescroll), with a big flick, you could flick the slider completely out of the carousel.

**The fix:** This bug was a regression — it didn't occur in previous versions. It was caused by using a different calculation for resting position after a flick. In an earlier change, I over-thought a solution and 'fixed' a problem that actually wasn't occurring. Reverting to the previous calculation fixed it.

**Learned:** The real trouble is that behavior features like flicking and dragging are difficult to reliably test. I have implemented some tests that fake these behaviors, but they don't always pass test 100% of the time. When I introduced this bug, the tests either didn't catch it, or I didn't have a test for it.

## Fixed prepend animation regression

**The issue:** [#201](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/201). Using [prepend](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/api.html#prepend) or [insert](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/api.html#insert) would cause the slider to animate. Another regression.

**The fix:** Set the position after inserting cells.

**Learned:** This regression was introduced with [lazyLoad](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/options.html#lazyload). I changed the behavior when adding or changing cell size. But I didn't think to see how this change affected prepend/insert.

## Allow range input sliding

**The issue:** [#216](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/216). Range type `<input>`s would not be able to slide within a Flickity cell.

**The fix:** Add logic so that any pointer on a range only works on the range, and does not trigger any Flickity behavior. While you can drag a Flickity slider by tapping down a button, or a text input, you cannot by tapping down on a range.

**Learned:** Sliders in sliders happen.

## Fix asNavFor double movement bug in iOS

**The issue:** [#189](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/189). With iOS, tapping on a nav gallery using [asNavFor](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/options.html#asnavfor) would cause it to shift once then again.

**Learned:** The bug was caused by iOS emulated click event. iOS and older versions of Chrome for Android [fake a `click` event](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away) 300 millisecond after a user taps on the screen (See also [Taps are faster than clicks](/blog/taps-are-faster-than-clicks/)). Typically, this click event is harmless, as the earlier tap event works as well on Flickity. But with the asNavFor, it was causing a tap/click to occur on two different cells. The behavior worked something like this:

1. Tap on the cell to move
2. Nav gallery shifts to new cell
3. Fake click is triggered on new cell where previous cell was
4. Nav gallery shifts again

**The fix:** I added timing logic to listen for these fake click events that happen after touch events. It's a bit of a hack, but it does the job. No double taps.

## Fixed staticClick triggering after scroll on touch devices

**The issue:** [Flickity's staticClick event](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/api.html#staticclick) was being triggered after scrolling the page on a touch device.

**The fix:** After pressing down, listen for `scroll` events. If page scrolls a bit, cancel the click behavior.

**Learned:** Touch devices do this as a standard behavior as part of their OS. You can press down on a button, and see that button activated. Once you start scrolling the page, the button is deactivated.
