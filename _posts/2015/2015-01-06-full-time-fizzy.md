Yesterday was my last at Twitter. Today is my first, full-time at Metafizzy.

[When I started this business four years ago](/blog/beginning/), it was an experiment and a side-project. It was based on the idea that code can be worth more than GitHub stars and Twitter favorites. I've spent my mornings, nights, and weekends developing it. Even with this limited amount of time, the business has grown well — well enough to be my main gig.

Just like when I started, there are plenty of uncertainties. Gone are the comforts of steady income, deferred management, and company benefits. It's all up to me now. Things are getting _real_.

In the face of these unknowns, I am thrilled for what's to come. The work on [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) has been some of my proudest. With this experience, I'm already hard at work developing a new product, [Flickity](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity). I now have the time to properly manage issues and emails and old code. Expect new things to be made and old things to get better.

My heartfelt thanks goes out to you who have purchased a license. Your support in real, monetary terms has enabled me to take the next step in my career and the next step for Metafizzy. I hope to do great things with it.

_— Dave_
