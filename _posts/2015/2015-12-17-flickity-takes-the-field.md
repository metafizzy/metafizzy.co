title: Flickity takes The Field
---

[_The Field_](http://www.thefieldmag.com/) is a new outdoor lifestyle publication, or as founder Chris Stillitano puts it, "_The Field_ is a place for good design and the great outdoors." It's also a great place to see Flickity in use.

_The Field_'s beautiful photo galleries are made with [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/). It's great to see how they've taken advantage of Flickity's [customizable previous & buttons](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/style.html#previous-next-buttons) to minimally style and position them. The slide counters change [on `cellSelect`](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/api.html#cellselect).

The site has a keen design sense, utilizing different layouts for its various content types. So much care went into these photo galleries. Watch how images resize and center while resizing the browser, even with images of varying aspect ratios.

What truly melts my heart is how well Flickity fits inside of _The Field_'s greater presentation. It works along side the publication's captivating photography and insightful commentary. Chris & co. are able to use Flickity to tell a bigger story — Flickity just plays a small part.
